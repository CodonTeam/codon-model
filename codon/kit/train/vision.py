    Executes a single end-to-end training step for an AutoencoderVisionModel.

    This function handles image splitting (with necessary padding), forward passes for both 
    the generator (AutoencoderVisionModel) and the discriminator (PatchDiscriminator), 
    loss calculations (including GAN, LPIPS, L1/MSE, and Quantization), and backpropagation.

    Args:
        model (AutoencoderVisionModel): The autoencoder vision model.
        discriminator (PatchDiscriminator): The PatchGAN discriminator.
        optimizer_g (torch.optim.Optimizer): Optimizer for the autoencoder model.
        optimizer_d (torch.optim.Optimizer): Optimizer for the discriminator.
        image (Union[torch.Tensor, str, Image.Image, np.ndarray]): The input image.
        patch_size (int): The patch size used by the model. Defaults to 12.
        recon_loss_type (Literal['l1', 'mse']): Type of reconstruction loss. Defaults to 'l1'.
        recon_weight (float): Weight for the reconstruction loss. Defaults to 1.0.
        perceptual_loss_fn (Callable, optional): Initialized LPIPS or other perceptual loss function. Defaults to None.
        perceptual_weight (float): Weight for the perceptual loss. Defaults to 1.0.
        adv_weight (float): Weight for the generator's adversarial GAN loss. Defaults to 0.1.
        quant_weight (float): Weight for the lookup-free quantization loss. Defaults to 1.0.

    Returns:
        AutoVisionTrainResult: Dataclass containing all the calculated losses and metrics.
